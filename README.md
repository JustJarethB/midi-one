# My First Teensy Project

## Goal
Okay, so this may not be the smartest thing to do as a first real Arduino (Teensy) project, but if I take it step by step maybe I'll end up with something not half bad...

On the other hand, this may end up an unfinished project like so often happens. We shall see.

The aim of this project is to create a working MIDI controller, with fully digital components and visual/physical feedback. Starting small, this will be expanded when the feasibility is better known. Beginning with simple push buttons and potentiometers to the final items planned for use. It may even get an enclosure eventually

## End Goal:

- - [ ] MIDI Output
- - [ ] Change On Touch Read
- - [ ] Motor From MIDI Input Value
- - [ ] Control Different Values
- [ ] Rotary Encoder w/ LED
- - [ ] MIDI Output
- - [ ] Value Reflected By LED Ring
- - [ ] Control Different Values
- [ ] Set MIDI Channels
- [ ] Set MIDI Param Per Item
